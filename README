Business::Bof::Server 0.07
==========================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

NOTE

The Class::DBI module (Business::Bof::Data::Fw) is tweaked to work with
SQLite right now. It shouldn't be difficult making it work with
PostgreSQL though.

SSL

A couple of notes about SSL (introduced in Bof 0.02).

You need two keys to certify your server. If you want to use self signed
certificates, you should be able to create them with something like
this:

openssl req -new -nodes -x509 -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365 \
   -subj "/C=US/ST=CO/L=City/CN=localhost/emailAddress=root@localhost"

One problem I encountered with SSL had nothing to do with the server,
but rather was hidden deep inside SOAP::Lite. The "500 Can't locate
object method "new" via package "LWP::Protocol::https::Socket" wasn't
the most helpful one.

The problem turned out to be two missing modules:

Net::SSL and
IO::Socket::SSL

Perhaps SOAP::Lite recommends them, but they're not required.
